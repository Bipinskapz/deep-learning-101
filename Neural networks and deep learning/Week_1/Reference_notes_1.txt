## High level understanding of a neural network

Assume neural network(NN) as a box, when we give an input to a neural network we get an output.
           				    _____
				input ---->| NN  |----> output
           				    -----

There is no meed for feature engg of data before giving it to the NN like in traditional machine learning algorithms.
NN assigns a weight value for each feature in the input dataset, so if a feature does not effect the output of the NN, the weight value for that feature is given a very low value.
Thus, a NN takes care of the feature engg for you.

## Supervised learning examples

	Problem					Architecture

   1. Real estate price prediction 	   Standard neural network
   2. Classification of traffic lights	   Convolutional neural network
   3. Language translation		   Recurrent neural network
   4. Position of other cars
      (self-driving cars)   		   Hybrid of the above architectures

## Why deeplearning is taking off ???
Three reasons for the boom of deep learning:
	* Data - a huge amount of data is generated every second 
	* Computation - we have shifted from CPUs to GPUs and now even to TPUs
	* Algorithms  - a lot of algorithms have been developed not only for new problems like generation but also to increase the training speed 
			of NNs

    ** If the data available for a problem is less, traditional ML algorithms may outperform NN models(depends on the feature engg skillset of the researcher).
